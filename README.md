# cancer_gene_networks
## Implemented SSN by DiWANN network
## Find neighbors by max degree values, max betweenness values, and DFS
## The step above are implemented in Copy_of_CPT_S575_final_project_SSN.ipynb files
## Construct Protein-Protein interaction network by StringDB
## Find the key genes and evaluate them by HPA database
## The step above are implemented in Protein_Interaction_Network_extention.Rmd file
